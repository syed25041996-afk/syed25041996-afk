# 👋 Hi, I’m Syed Hussaini  

🚀 **DevOps Engineer | Platform & Cloud Enthusiast | Full-Stack Background**

I’m a DevOps-oriented software engineer with hands-on experience building, deploying, and operating **production-style infrastructure and applications**.  
I enjoy turning ideas into **automated, observable, and reliable systems** — from code to cloud.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On
- CI/CD automation & GitOps workflows  
- Kubernetes & containerized platforms  
- Cloud-native infrastructure & IaC  
- Observability, reliability, and security  
- Learning by building **real production-like systems**

## 🏗️ DevOps Homelab & Platform Engineering Journey

I maintain a **production-style homelab** to practice real-world DevOps and SRE workflows beyond day-to-day development work.

**What I’ve built & operate:**
- ⚙️ Multi-node **Kubernetes clusters** (bare metal + virtualized)
- 🔁 **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions & Jenkins
- 🚀 **GitOps deployments** using ArgoCD
- 📦 Docker & Docker Compose for application packaging
- 🧱 Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform & Ansible**
- 📊 Monitoring & logging with **Prometheus, Grafana & Loki**
- 🌐 Nginx reverse proxy with **SSL/TLS**
- 🔐 Security practices: RBAC, secrets management, least privilege
- 🧪 Incident simulation, recovery testing & performance tuning

This lab mirrors how modern production platforms are designed, deployed, monitored, and secured.
